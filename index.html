        <h2>Further Explanation</h2>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Since the beginning of "Avast Ye" we knew we wanted the player to be a Captain. Not just that the character they would play would have the title "Captain", but we wanted to give the player the feeling that
          they were in command. We also knew that we wanted to play into the fact that the player character and their crew were ants. This turned into the idea that we would give the player several crew members that were differnt
          kinds of ant or bugs and thus had varying abilities of their own. As Captain, the player would be able to direct their crew in how these abilities should be used. The question then became "how do we allow the player to easily
          control several characters at once on a controller?" One of the earliest ideas I had was that of an ability wheel similar to the one in Bioware's "Mass Effect", which I implemented and can be seen in the video below.
        </p>
        <iframe class="myvideo" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y21xcpA10f4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p class="video_text"> Early "Avast Ye" Ability Wheel</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This worked, but it felt like the player was taken out of the action too much. We needed something that was, as one of our pillars said, "Short plan, high action". We needed the player to plan quickly, and not be
          stuck slowing down or pausing time in an ability wheel. After considering what to do I turned to the new "God of War" game for inspiration. Atreus is a perfect example of an ally AI who in helpful, but not overpowered, and is easy
          to control. In fact there is a button dedicated only to him the entire game. The player taps it to make him fire arrows, and holds it to activate his special ability. I thought this would be really helpful for our AI companions.
          So we gave each crew member their own button and two abilities: a tap and a hold (the hold generally being the more powerful of the two.) These abilities could be used in combat, as well as in world exploration and puzzle-solving.</p>
        <iframe class="myvideo" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C8XF1H5Vb70" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p class="video_text"> Older versions of Crew Abilities</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This was great, but it wasn't as engaging as we wanted. It felt like something was missing. Then Patrick Spencer, the Tech Lead, found inspiration from the film "Avengers". Particularly
          the scene where they finally team up in New York and uses their abilities together against the alien invasion. He then implemented the first version of what we would later call the "Follow-Up System".
          In this first implementation, certain actions, (that we called "Set-Ups") could trigger a possible Follow-Up. For example, if the Captain knocked an enemy into the air with her heavy attack, a prompt would appear to press the
          Bull Ant's button. If this button was pressed the Bull Ant would charge the enemy while still in the air, sending them flying extra far. This prompt was only available for a brief moment, similar to a quick time event,
          but without a negative consequence if it was missed. It was just an opportunity to team up with your crew more. This became the main mechanic of our game.
        </p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp However, in this first iteration, each Set-Up was tied to one specific Follow-Up. The knock-up only triggered a Follow-Up from the Bull Ant, and you had to use a dash attack to
          trigger a Follow-Up from the Fire Ant. This proved to be too much for a lot of players to remember, as well as difficult for us to teach to a new player. I then altered the Follow-Up system to allow for any crew member
          to follow up on any Set-Up that wasn't their own. I also changed it so that every crew member's Hold ability was a Set-Up, and many of the crew Follow-Ups were also Set-Ups. This way, the player could experiement
          with different Follow-Ups to different Set-Ups as well as chain Follow-Ups together.
        </p>
        <p>The following videos are of the current crew abilities and Follow-Ups as well as some examples of chaining Follow-Ups together.</p>

        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Further Explanation</h2>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Enemy AI is one of the things we iterated on the most. We started out with Enemies that used AI perception and would aggro when they saw you, but decided that
          because we didn't want stealth sections or for the player to be able to run and leave combat without killing everyone in an encounter, perception wasn't something worth keeping around.
          Instead we would just start combat with trigger boxes. Once that was establish we had to decide how the AI would behave; how they would pick their targets, what their attack pattern would be, etc.
          In one of the earliest renditions of Enemy AI, I had an Enemy AI Director that would pick targets for each Enemy assigned to it based on which enemies were closest to the Captain and her crew. I wanted
          the number of enemies to be split somewhat evenly between the crew, however, so that the player wouldn't be overwhelmed, so I had the Director see which fourth of the enemies were closest
          to the Captain, and have them target her, and then the fourth closest to the Bull Ant that weren't already targeting the Captain, and so on. The initial version of this had them unable to change their targets unless attacked by
          another crew member, which caused some obvious issues when the player ran off after other enemies, so I later changed this targeting from a task executed once at the beginning of the behavior tree, to
          a service that would run every second or so. This allowed enemies to switch targets more often and made it so that the Captain couldn't run behind some other enemies to escape the ones targeting her. The Enemy AI Director
          also controlled which enemies could attack, so that only two or three could attack the same target at the same time, making sure the player wouldn't just get mobbed by a whole group.
        </p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Even with this, however, our Enemy AI didn't feel good in combat. The limited number of attackers and the attack pattern they had felt good when just the Captain was playing, but once we
          had all the crew members in there it just didn't feel right. Something was missing and we weren't sure what it was. So we went and looked at the Enemy AI in some other games. In particular, we looked at the newest
          Spider-Man game by Insomniac because it had a similar combat style, with the player character snapping to enemies and being very fast and mobile. After watching how their enemies behaved it seemed like
          their melee enemies all had a random chance to attack that increased the closer they were to the player. This way a few of them would be attacking at a time, but most of them would just be hanging out in the back waiting.
          So I tried to implement a similar system, giving enemies a chance to attack that was increased the closer they were to their target. I also added a modifier that would increase that chance to nearly 100% if no one was attacking, so that
          there would always be at least one enemy attacking. I also created a new way enemies picked their targets. They would weight each of the possible targets based on distance, add an extra bit of weight to their current target (if they had
          one) and then make a weighted random choice. This would also run every second or so, to allow them to switch targets if their current target got too far away. This worked well, but it ended up behaving very similarly to
          the previous versions of Enemy AI; it felt great with just the Captain, but not with the whole crew.
        </p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Finally we realized that the problem was with the playstyles these behaviors created. Our main mechanic, the Follow-Up System, was most satisfying when used on large groups of enemies due to most
          Crew Abilities being AOE. However, the fact that enemies could constantly be switching targets often lead to very chaotic and spread out fights that didn't always have clear groups of enemies on which to use Crew Abilities.
          This lead to players using their abilities less and picking the enemies off one at a time with their sword.
        </p>

        <p class="video_text"> Example of early Enemy AI behavior</p>

        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I then went to work on a new system in which enemies would be grouped more often, and thus create more enticing targets for Crew Abilities and Follow-Ups. The current system uses an Enemy AI Director
          to divide the enemies it controls into groups of 4 to 5 the best it can, picks a leader for the group, and then spawns a Group Director for each group. The Group Director then determines the actions the group should take. If the
          members of the crew are too spread out the Group Director will have them form up on the group leader. The Group Director also picks the target for the group and has the group move in a messy formation (they're pirate cockroaches, not
          trained soldiers)
          to that target to attack. If the group leader dies or is the only surviving member of the group, the Group Director will disband the group and switch the remaining members to a more individualistic behavior (the one based on Spider-Man).

        <h2>What I Did</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Everything related to the targeting of abilities, and it's connection to the UI. (I did not create the UI art asset or do the UI animation, but I did program the logic to determine when it should be shown)</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Further Explanation</h2>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We wanted the targeting of abilities to be easy and intuitive. We didn't want them to be difficult to aim, and we also wanted the player to know beforehand who or what they were
          targeting. Also, because crew abilities can target both enemies and environmental objects, the targeting system needed to be able to accommodate for this. The current system now targets the closest thing to the center of the screen
          , whether that is an enemy or an environmental object. What you are targeting is also clearly shown by the UI.

        <p></p>
        <h2>Further Explanation</h2>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After we finally nailed down our core mechanic, <a href="#abilities">the Follow-Up System</a>, we realized that because it was pretty different from any other games
          most of our playtester had played, it was hard to make sure they understood the mechanics enough to use them effectively without us telling them exactly what to do. This made us realize that even though we
          were only making a slice of a game for our submission to the E3 competition, we would probably need a tutorial section to help players get the hang of Follow-Ups. So the director, Jessica Runyan, and I
          designed a tutorial area that would lead into the main level that was being built. We tried to create a tutorial that would teach players what they needed and hopefully be engaging enough that they wouldn't
          just skip through all the text boxes.</p>

        <p></p>
        <h2>Further Explanation</h2>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the time to submit the game to E3 grew closer, we realized that our idea for the main boss (pictured below) would not be possible to polish before our deadline due to the kinds of animations he would need.
          So we opted to create a simple mini boss as a placeholder. He was just a larger Cockroach enemy with a different texture and a few special abilities.</p>
        <img id="centigreed" src="/images/centigreed.jpg">
        <p class="video_text">Pirate King Centigreed, to be added to Avast Ye in an update before Feb 2020. Model and Texture credit: Sloan Poleman</p>
        <p> However, after our E3 submission we talked about keeping him around, and I had the idea
          of having multiple versions of him that the player would fight as they progressed through the level. The other leads liked this idea and after discussing it we decided that it would be the same cockroach and he would run away each time
          the player fought him until the final encounter. We also decided that he would be Centigreed's first mate who was trying to keep you from getting to his captain.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When designing the last two encounters I wanted to have each one be different from the last. I designed the Cannon Boss Fight first, and the pillar destruction came from wanting to use the boss fight to test what
          the player has learned about Luna, their
          newly acquired Witch Doctor companion. One of Luna's abilities is to levitate things, and before the boss fight there are several opportunities to use her levitate ability to lift objects in the world. In the boss fight, two of the three
          chalk pillars require that
          the player use the levitate to lift bombs closer to the weak points. Before this, however, the first pillar has it's weak point at it's base to allow the player to first experience the interaction between bombs and weak points and then see
          if they can make the connection
          to use levitate to get closer to those weakpoints.</p>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For the Final encounter I wanted to do something similar to what the player had already experienced, but force the player to think about the fight differently than before, especially in the melee fight.
          So I gave the Boss a shield that blocked incoming damage and cancelled Follow-Ups when it was up. This forced players to strategize when to use their Follow-Ups so they would be effective. I tried to make it so that there wasn't a super
          specific way players had to fight him too. Players area able to break the shield after a certain amount of damage, or disable the shield temporarily wiht abilities like the Bull Ant Charge, and Witch Doctor Levitate, or plyaers
          can also wait to attack when the shield is lowered. I also wanted to use more combinations of Crewmember abilites like in the Cannon fight, but because the Bull Ant wasn't used much in the Cannon Fight, I wanted him to be a key part
          in this fight. Thus the main combo in the thrown objects stage is to stop a projectile with Levitate, and then knock it back at the Boss with the Bull Ant Charge.</p>

        <p>Below are videos of the 3 encounters with the Cockroach Boss. Note that at the time these videos were taken
          the boss had no animation for running away so he plays his death animation in each encounter instead.</p>

        <h3>Electro-Thief</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h1> About Electro-Thief</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>Electro-Thief is a fast-paced stealth/action game in which you use your acrobatic mobility as well as a super-powered robotic arm to traverse corporate headquarters and storage facilities to steal materials and exact vengence in a
          pre-cyberpunk world. The main mechnics have to do with the magnetic powers of your characters robotic arm. It has two modes: Push and Pull. You can use these on any metalic surfaces or objects in the world. Pushing on something smaller
          than you will push it away from you. Pushing on something bigger than you will push you away from it. Same thing for pull, but opposite. In the futuritc world in which Electro-Thief is set there will be a lot of metal, which will
          provide the player with many ways to use these mechanics in creative ways to get to their goal.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Electro-Thief is the personaly project of mine that I have pushed the farthest and the one I am currently working on in my spare time. It began as a small demo that I made to use when I pitched the idea for the game to the BYU Animation
          students to be the game we made for 2018-2019. When Avast Ye was picked instead of Electro-Thief it got put on the shelf for awhile. Recently I decided to pull it back out and make it myself.</p>

        <h1> Pitch Demo</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>To show how far it has come, below is the video I used in my original pitch to demonstrate the main mechanic of the game.</p>
        <p></p>

        <h1>Playtest 1</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>This is Electro-Thief after revamping it and creating a test course that I could ship out to people so they could test it for me. Below the video I'll go through some of the main mechanics/design decisions I made and why.</p>
        <p></p>

        <h2>First Person</h2>
        <p> The biggest change from the original demo to the first playtest was the change from 3rd Person to 1st Person. Originally I pitched it as a 3rd person game because I wanted our artists to be able to create an awesome looking
          character that would be seen as it was played. Now that I'm making it on my own, however, I decided to go with a 1st Person view so that I wouldn't have to spend as much time on a character model. Also as I built out the mechanics it made
          more sense for
          them to be used in 1st Person</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Locking Pull and Swing</h2>
        <p>One problem from the pitch version of the mechanics was that if you were pulling an object to you it would move and if there was anything metal behind what you were trying to pull you would start pulling on it unless you followed
          what you were trying to pull perfectly. To avoid this I changed it so that the pull would lock onto an object/spot. As I was testing this I found that because you were locked onto a spot on larger objects, and also due to the magnetic
          force scaling with distance, you could magnetically swing from metal objects above you. It's awesome! It quickly became my favorite mechanic and I decided to try to build my game around it a little more. In future levels I plan to have
          alternate routes that will require the player to swing skillfully to their destination.</p>
        <p></p>
        <!--h2>Movement Mechanics</h2>
        <p>After discovering the magnet swing and its uses, I decided that it would be fun to try to make a fast-paced stealth game in which movement would play a big role. I wanted even more mobility than what the magnet swing offered so
          I decided to add a few more movement mechanics: sliding, ledge grabs, and wall jumping.</p-->
